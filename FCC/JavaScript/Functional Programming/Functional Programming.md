# Functional Programming

> Functional programming is about:

1. Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

1. Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

1. Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

### Learn About Functional Programming

> In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC variable.

```javascript
/**
 * A long process to prepare tea.
 * @return {string} A cup of tea.
 **/
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/**
 * Get given number of cups of tea.
 * @param {number} numOfCups Number of required cups of tea.
 * @return {Array<string>} Given amount of tea cups.
 **/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];
  
  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }

  return teaCups;
};

// Add your code below this line

const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40); // :(

// Add your code above this line

console.log(tea4TeamFCC);
```

### Understand Functional Programming Terminology

> The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.


> Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.


```javascript
/**
 * A long process to prepare green tea.
 * @return {string} A cup of green tea.
 **/
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

/**
 * A long process to prepare black tea.
 * @return {string} A cup of black tea.
 **/
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/**
 * Get given number of cups of tea.
 * @param {function():string} prepareTea The type of tea preparing function.
 * @param {number} numOfCups Number of required cups of tea.
 * @return {Array<string>} Given amount of tea cups.
 **/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }

  return teaCups;
};

// Add your code below this line

const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27); // :(
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13); // :(

// Add your code above this line

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);
```
